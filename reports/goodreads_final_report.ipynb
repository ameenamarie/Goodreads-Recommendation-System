    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Goodreads is a social media platform that allows users to rate and review books as well as see what their friends are reading, rating, and reviewing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can use the platform to keep track of the books that they have read while also identifying books they'd like to read next. In addition to pulling reading recommendations from their friends' profiles, they can also receive book recommendations through the Goodreads recommender system. However, based on personal experience, the system does not always offer the most helpful suggestions. Most of the books it recommends are obscure and do not appear to be based on what a user previously rated or what their friends have read. \n",
    "\n",
    "Seeing as Amazon purchased Goodreads in 2013, this seems like a huge missed opportunity to provide useful book recommendations that could turn into book sales.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Is it possible to create a more useful recommendation system for readers? \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data \n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question I will be using the Goodbooks __[datasets](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k)__ provided by Github user __[zygmuntz](https://github.com/zygmuntz)__. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Goodbooks dataset includes over six million ratings of ten thousand books on Goodreads. It is separated into three different files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ratings:** Contains nearly 6 million user ratings from 53,424 users \n",
    "* **To-Read:** Contains nearly 1 million books that users added to their 'to-read' shelf \n",
    "* **Books:** Contains all of the meta data for 10,000 books. The metadata includes: title, author, number of ratings, number of each type of rating, and more \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this project, I will be using the Ratings and Books datasets.\n",
